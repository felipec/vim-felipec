felipec is my own personal vim colorscheme I've been tuning for several years.

Dark, bright, and simple.

Disillusioned with all the other colorschemes and generators I decided to create my own.
The template format draws inspiration from https://github.com/jacoborus/estilo/[estilo], but it's much more simple.

There's also lightline and airline colorschemes, as well as kitty, xfce4-terminal and highlight.js themes.
